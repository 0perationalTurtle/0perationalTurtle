I am a passionate and result-driven individual with a background in Web Design and Development from Humber Polytechnic and a Postgraduate Certification in Cybersecurity from Cambrian College, I bridge the gap between user-friendly technology and robust security. My passion for cybersecurity stems from my deep understanding of web technologies and my commitment to safeguarding digital spaces. As I launch my career in cybersecurity, my goal is to transition into a SOC Analyst role, where I can proactively detect, analyze, and mitigate threats. Whether troubleshooting IT issues, automating security processes, or fortifying systems against cyber risks, I am dedicated to securing the webâ€”one user at a time. Here, youâ€™ll find my projects on vulnerability analysis, the use of Security tools, and threat analysis, all reflecting my drive to create a safer digital world. Let's connect and collaborate! ðŸš€
